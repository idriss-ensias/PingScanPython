# PingScanPython
Using threads and the ping3 package, this small script scans a LAN with ping for live hosts.
## Improvements
I intend on optimizing the script to automaticaly detect the main NIC network address (routing table) and mask and not only relying on ping but also using other forms of reconnaissance methods such as the SYN scan.
